# Differentiable Fuzzy Logics

## Requirements
The code is tested for
* Python 3.8
* PyTorch 1.8.1
* TensorboardX

Similar configurations should also work.

## MNIST Experiments
See the `dfl` folder for the semi-supervised MNIST experiments. 
multiconfig.py can be used to reproduce the experiments (mostly). main.py can be called with the appropriate argument to produce any kind of experiment or combination.
